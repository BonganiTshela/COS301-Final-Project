	\section{Description} %-------The description starts here-----------------------%
	In this project we are required to create an application that will verify and validate the identity of an individual. This verification and validation should be done using the individual’s identity number, name, surname and a photo of their identity document. This data will then be compared to data stored in a database for authentication. The application should then give a percentage match score. \\
Some of the technologies are PostgreSQL, Python and JavaScript since this application has to do most of its functionality will be does in the web based app.\\

  \section{Methodology} %-------The Methodology starts here-----------------------%
  We are going to use the agile software development methodologies – as they emphasize real time communication and a relatively high customer involvement. We as a team will be working closely together (pair programming) and we will be meeting at least a week to work on the project.  We are also be planning to be in constant communication with the lectures so that they can assist when we need help and track our progress. 
As a team we think we should be in constant communication with the client so that they are aware of the development and the progress the team is making. The client should also be notified or consulted with projects enhancement or module improvements.
Documentation is another important part of our methodology as it will also assist and facilitate communication between all the stakeholders involved in development process. Documentation is particularly important to the development team as it will focus our efforts in the same direction since we all understand and have the same goal. However, in the early stages we will only create documentation that is necessary to start developing and then elaborate more on the requirements as we progress with the development.
\\
  \section{Team members details}%-----More details about the team-----------------%
  Our team consists of 5 individuals in the final year of our BSc Computer Science and Information Technology degrees, we all have similar skill sets with relation to coding software engineering. \\
	The programming languages we are more familiar with include: \\
	\begin{itemize}
      \item C++
      \item Python
      \item Java
      \item Web scripting languages ( both MEAN and LAMP stack)
      \item Shell scripting (Linux and Windows) 
      \item Assembly language\\
    \end{itemize}
     
    The set of skills that we have are not limited to those we are taught( as students). As a programmer the ability to learn and adapt quickly is very essential. As a team we believe that we have this ability in abundance. \\
	
	\\The project will be divided up into segments with whichever member feels they will produce the best final product in and because we will be meeting and working together, all members will come together and consolidate the system to make sure it meets with the client's expectations.\\
