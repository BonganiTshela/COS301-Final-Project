## COS 301 Capstone project
### Benchmarking Service
---
## Team name:  ProCoders.
## OverView of Project
The system provides a web interface for users to request and specify the benchmarking services they need. The services will be provided by executing the requested benchmarks on isolated machines where the side-effects that are not a concern of the specified benchmark is minimized. The system measures a variety of performance attributes such as CPU time, elapsed time, memory usage, power consumption, heat generation, etc. It accepts source code for Java programming language and text. The system is set to run on the linux bare-metal machine and run benchmarks on seperate benchmarking nodes(both bare-metal and uni-kernels). The compilation of algorithms will be done before benchmarking, thus reducing overhead.


The system then produces the results graphically so that they are easily readable, the results are also downloadable. Registered users will be able to save their results in PDF form and will be able to view previous benchmarks while unregistered users will not be able to.
